Max tokens: You can set a maximum number of tokens for the response to limit the length of the generated output. This could be useful for users who want shorter or longer responses.

Top-p: Top-p sampling is an alternative to temperature for controlling the randomness of the model's output. Lower values make the output more focused, while higher values make it more random.

Presence penalty: This parameter encourages the model to use entities (e.g., people, places, things) mentioned in the conversation more often in its responses. Higher values increase the likelihood of the model reusing entities.

Frequency penalty: This parameter encourages the model to use less common words in its responses. Higher values make the output more diverse and creative, while lower values make it more focused on common words.

Response delay: You can add an option to simulate a delay in the model's response time, making it feel more like a real conversation with a human.

Context length: You can allow users to set a limit on how much conversation history the model should consider when generating a response. This could be helpful for users who want the model to focus more on recent messages.

Language: If you want to support multiple languages, you can add an option to choose the language for the generated responses.
